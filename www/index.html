				<p>Pardus was a Linux based operating system developed from scratch, which had its own packaging system, unique configuration manager and installer. Project was started by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_National_Research_Institute_of_Electronics_and_Cryptology" target="_blank">Turkish National Research Institute of Electronics and Cryptology (UEKAE)</a>, a division of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_and_Technological_Research_Council_of_Turkey" target="_blank">the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK)</a>.</p>

				<p>The project was welcomed by the open source community all around the world, thanks to its innovations, ease of use and desktop polish.</p>
